# LadderAdventureGame
This assignment was a component of my Object-Oriented Programming module. In Adventure Escape, each floor presents the user with the challenge of defeating floor masters (enemies) to progress to the next level, ultimately culminating at the Tower of God, a final floor that remains uncharted. With each victorious battle, users earn power-ups, and they also have the option to select special races, each endowed with unique traits. The ultimate goal is to defeat all enemies and successfully escape.
